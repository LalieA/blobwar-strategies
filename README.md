# Blobwar game basic algorithms implementation

## Blobwar Game principle
You must take control of the war board by attacking with your blobs againist to your opponent's. Your target is converting your opponent's blobs into your own. 

The aim of the game is to take control of the war board by attacking opponent's blobs with yours.

## Run a game

Define your strategies for the two players in `main.rs`, then compile and run project: 

```
cargo run --bin blobwar
```

## Algorithms implemented
The source codes are available in the folder `src/strategy/`.
